This component you're reading is a text component. All components take this form of a title and body 
- except a blank component. However it's important to realise that title and body attributes are not needed. 
<br><br>
Take for instance the media component opposite or below on a smaller device - <b>has no body attribute</b>. 
Instead of the HTML being rendered Adapt simply doesn't render it. The title attribute is simply a break tag to push the 
media component level with the opposite component.

	<li>Long long bodys of text in general!!</li>
